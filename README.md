# Sorting-Efficiency
Sorting Efficiency is a program that allows the user to use various sorting algorithms to sort and compare data.

The user will be given the choice for how big they want an array to be, which will be filled with random numbers. The user will then select a sorting algorithm to organize the randomly generated array indexes. When finished, the program will print the sorted array, alongside the amount of time and cycles it took to be completed. 

The code can use the following alogorithms: <br>
**Bubble sort:** Compare adjacent items and swaps if in the incorrect order <br>
**Selection Sort:** Actively searches for smallest items to place in correct order <br>
**Quick Sort:** The items are sorted around a randomly selected item
